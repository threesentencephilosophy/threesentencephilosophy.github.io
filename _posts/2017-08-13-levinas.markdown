Emmanuel Levinas was a 20th-century Lithuanian-Jewish philosopher (his major works were Totality and Infinity (1961) and Otherwise Than Being, 1974) who developed a [phenomenological]() account of ethics influenced greatly by the Talmudic writings and early 20th-century French phenomenology. [Ethics]() for Levinas did not begin with laws, or even the subject's [consciousness](), but rather preceded consciousness as a primordial impulse toward and for [the Other]().
