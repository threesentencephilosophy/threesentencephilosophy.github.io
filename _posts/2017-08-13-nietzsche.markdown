Friedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher writing in the latter part of the 19th century (his first work, The Birth of Tragedy, was published in 1874). Throughout his major works, Zarathustra (1883), Beyond Good and Evil (1886) and On the Genealogy of Morals (1887), Nietzsche develops a polemically charged, historical account of the origins of man's moral conscience (articulated as a form of guilty indebtedness to previous generations) that replaces God-given conscience.
